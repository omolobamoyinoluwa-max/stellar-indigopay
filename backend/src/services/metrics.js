/**
 * src/services/metrics.js
 *
 * Centralised Prometheus metrics for the Stellar IndigoPay backend.
 *
 * Exports a single shared `Registry` plus the conventional metric handles
 * used across the app. We deliberately use ONE shared registry (not one
 * per subsystem) so that the `/metrics` endpoint can emit everything in a
 * single scrape. Cardinality is controlled by:
 *   - route normalisation (`:id` patterns collapsed before labelling)
 *   - status-code bucketing (status is taken raw — there are only ~60
 *     distinct status codes we ever emit, so this is safe)
 *   - method allow-list (only GET / POST / PATCH / PUT / DELETE)

# Postgres Restore Runbook

This runbook covers restoring the production Postgres database from
the latest S3 backup. Use it during a real incident after the on-call
has confirmed the database is corrupt or the data is unrecoverable
from the running cluster.

## Pre-flight

1. Confirm the incident: a healthy cluster returns 200 on
   `/api/readyz` and the `db_pool_waiting_count` gauge is 0. If
   not, the issue is elsewhere — do not proceed.
2. Identify the restore target time. Aim for the most recent WAL
   archive. Confirm it exists:
   ```bash
   aws s3 ls s3://${S3_BUCKET}/backups/ --recursive | tail -20
   ```
3. Announce in the on-call channel: "Beginning restore from
   ${TIMESTAMP}, downtime expected 30-60 min."

## Provision a fresh database

1. Spin up a clean Postgres pod (or RDS instance) at the version
   matching production (`postgres:16-alpine` for k8s, the matching
   engine version for RDS). DO NOT touch the broken pod.
2. Restore the base backup:
   ```bash
   aws s3 cp s3://${S3_BUCKET}/backups/indigopay_backup_${TIMESTAMP}.sql.gz /tmp/
   gunzip /tmp/indigopay_backup_${TIMESTAMP}.sql.gz
   psql "postgres://${POSTGRES_USER}:${POSTGRES_PASSWORD}@${NEW_HOST}:5432/postgres" \
     -f /tmp/indigopay_backup_${TIMESTAMP}.sql
   ```
3. Verify the base restore:
   ```bash
   psql "postgres://...@${NEW_HOST}:5432/indigopay" \
     -c "SELECT count(*) FROM donations; SELECT count(*) FROM projects;"
   ```
4. Apply WAL archives from S3 (point-in-time recovery). The exact
   `restore_command` is set in `postgresql.conf`:
   ```ini
   restore_command = 'aws s3 cp s3://${S3_BUCKET}/wal/%f %p'
   recovery_target_time = '2026-07-09 10:30:00 UTC'
   recovery_target_action = 'promote'
   ```
5. `pg_ctl promote` (or `SELECT pg_promote();`) when replay catches
   up to the target time.

## Cutover

1. Stop the backend deployment:
   ```bash
   kubectl scale deploy/backend --replicas=0 -n indigopay
   ```
2. Update the `DATABASE_URL` secret in AWS Secrets Manager to point
   at the new host.
3. Restart the backend:
   ```bash
   kubectl scale deploy/backend --replicas=2 -n indigopay
   ```
4. Watch the readiness probe:
   ```bash
   kubectl logs -n indigopay -l app=backend -c backend --tail=200 -f
   ```
5. Smoke test: `curl https://api.indigopay.app/api/health` should
   return 200; `/api/projects` should return the expected list.

## Post-restore

1. Re-enable scheduled backups (the restored DB has no cron).
2. Verify webhook delivery resume: check `webhook_deliveries WHERE
   status='pending' AND next_attempt_at <= NOW()`.
3. Open a post-incident review within 48 hours.
4. Update RTO/RPO numbers in `docs/disaster-recovery.md` if the
   incident was longer/shorter than the target.

## Dry Run

The `restore-drill` workflow under `.github/workflows/restore-drill.yml`
runs this runbook on a cron (1st of every month) against an
ephemeral Postgres pod. Drill failures page on-call.
